## Ticketing


### Pricing[^1]

**What this means for you:** Pricing will be slightly different this year due to COVID-19, though we aim for these measures to be temporary. We have also introduced a clear policy for concessions, including thanking our key workers.

Our base pricing is **not changing** for this academic year, however two classes of additional fees will be applied depending on where they purchase their tickets. Customers and members will now be encouraged to purchase their tickets online, in order to assist us with our requirements due to reduced capacities and social distancing. There will be a **5% service fee + 20p ticket fee**[^2] on top of our base pricing to cover our costs from the new online system. When purchasing tickets in person, **a flat £1 fee applied per ticket**[^3], to encourage customers to purchase their tickets online.

Concession pricing will now be available to students of any age, all medical, care and NHS staff who work with patients, Young Scot/EYCA card holders and holders of any other NEC, provided that it is valid. ID will be requested before entry in all cases, and the difference between the price paid and the full-priced ticket + 50p will be charged if their status cannot be validated. This will be made clear at the time of booking.[^4]

Carers go free if they are taking the person in their care to a show. To request this and any other reasonable adjustment, please contact [foh@bedlamtheatre.co.uk](mailto:foh@bedlamtheatre.co.uk) at least 48 hours before the posted start time of the show.[^5]

Refunds will be available up until 24 hours before the posted start time of the show, with a £1 fee being withheld from the refund to cover our costs - this can be submitted in the link from your confirmation email. In exceptional cases, including COVID-19 related reasons, within 24 hours of the show, a voucher/gift card may be given. Please contact [foh@bedlamtheatre.co.uk](mailto:foh@bedlamtheatre.co.uk) to request this, or for any other details.[^6] 

Comps will be restricted during periods of reduced capacity, with **no less than 2 per night** [^7]available at our most restricted, slowly increasing to the normal 5 as maximum capacities increase. Front-of-House management will discuss your allocation per night when the Producer’s Questionnaire (PQ) is received. Any further comps will be charged at members’ rates, and can be allocated from Show Budgets, with approval from Finance.


### Reserved Seating

**What this means for you:** sSating will be reserved for all shows for 2021-22 even if restrictions reduce. This will allow us to reduce operational complexity and respond to rapidly-evolving restrictions surrounding COVID-19.

Bedlam will implement a seating numbers system, facilitating space-efficient socially distanced bookings. Seating will follow a “Row x Seat Number” system, with automatic socially distanced bookings facilitated through Pre-Tix. This 



* Row x seat number system
* Automatic 1.2m mouth-to-mouth distancing
* Through pretix
* I/o hall SCAN, check any ID cards, then LEAD to seat
* Audio advice before show saying to DBAD
    * To be written and recorded (preferably Scottish accent).
* Usher leads audience out row by row (airplane style)
* ‘Please don’t get out of your seat’ but that’s all we do - included in DBAD audio.
* ALL SHOWS under ‘no late policy’, individual shows can choose entry at interval or not, no refunds given in this case except by application. No re-entry mid show as policy.
* Questions to be asked through pretix - If YES to any, deny entry and provide a refund (including booking fees):
    * Do you have symptoms? 
    * Have you been told to self-isolate by any authority/place of work in the last 14 days? 
    * Have you tested positive?


## Accessibility

**What this means for you:** In the event of a wheelchair user requiring access to Bedlam, they will be asked to reach out 48-hours in advance. Two seats will be reserved and used for walk-ins if there are no audience members with accessibility requirements. 


## Box Office



* Use PretixPOS + Square
* £1 flat rate higher in person
* Cashless (exceptional circs allow exact change)
* Advertise cheaper online!


## Café

**What this means for you**: Unfortunately, the café will not be opening until the beginning of Semester two at the earliest. This is due to food hygiene, social distancing and ventilation concerns in light of COVID-19. This will be kept under review and decisions will be made on re-opening at a future date.


## Toilets

**What this means for you:** Toilets will be single-occupancy and gender neutral. A one-way system will be enforced, ensuring the safety of those in the building.


## Contact Tracing

**What this means for you:** In order to adhere to public health guidance, all households will be asked to provide contact tracing details to Bedlam Theatre. Staffers are required to notify Bedlam Theatre when told to isolate, and the Health and Safety officer will conduct contact tracing within the team.

Contact tracing QR codes will be placed around the building. Individuals will be reminded to scan the code and for those who prefer not to scan a QR code, individuals may dictate contract tracing information to the Box Officer. Contact tracing information is only required from one member of each household. Online bookings will not be required to provide their information in the building, as PreTix will ask for this information during the booking process. Customers will be asked upon arrival whether they have recently had any symptoms of COVID-19, whether they have had a recent positive test and whether they have been told to self-isolate as a close contact. If the answer to any of these questions is “Yes”, customers will be asked to leave the building.



* Codes around buildings - not enforced, but reminded once to scan.
* Not required for online bookings.
* Once per household sign-in.
* Digital form as backup - dictated to bofficer.
* Should notify BT if told to self isolate within 10 days of staffing
* All staffers will be told to self isolate if present
* Health and Safety officer will conduct contact tracing within the team
* Reminder that this is dubiously legally enforceable
* All staff will be questioned on arrival, same as for customers
    * If staff knowingly turn up and answer ‘Yes’ no debt will be forgiven


## Staffing

**What this means for you:** Staffing will remind a requirement for members of the show team, with some limited exceptions. PPE will be provided by Bedlam Theatre if required and enhanced cleaning procedures will be implemented.

	All members of the production team will be required to staff as usual, with additional training provided to members on COVID-19 mitigations. If an indebted member is unvaccinated or COVID-anxious and subsequently not present during show production, debt will be suspended. Face masks will be provided by Bedlam Theatre to staffers.


### Contact tracing and self-isolation

Staff are required to notify Bedlam Theatre if they are told to isolate within ten days of staffing. The Health and Safety officer will then conduct contact tracing within the team. Should you be notified by the Health and Safety officer that you are a close contact, you must follow the latest health guidance on testing and isolation. Bedlam staff will be asked upon arrival whether they have recently had any symptoms of COVID-19, whether they have had a recent positive test and whether they have been told to self-isolate as a close contact. If the answer to any of these questions is “Yes”, customers will be asked to leave the building.


### Duty Manager Training

**What this means for you:** The majority of Duty Manager (DM) training will take place online, with plans for a final in-person session to take place in Bedlam Theatre, in adherence with COVID-19 regulations. DM trainings will be given to UoE students only.

	For this year, DM training will be issued through the use of an online course platform such as Moodle. This will comprise a video walkthrough of the building, highlighting areas of importance. The training course will conclude with a final in-person session in groups of no more than 2-3 people, which will act as the final stage in qualifying the individual(s) for the DM role. To keep this as straightforward as possible, duty manager training will be limited to **UoE students only** this year.


### Ushering

**What this means for you:** All audience members will be shown directly to their seat by an usher. Before the show begins, they will then hear audio advice outlining they are not to leave their seat until the end of the show. They will also be ushered out of the auditorium row by row, ensuring social distancing is maintained.

Audience members will have to show their tickets upon entry to the building, and their QR code will be scanned. At this point a questionnaire will appear on the staff member’s tablet, with COVID-19 safety questions to be asked upon entry.

 The house will be open for twice as long as pre-covid (at least 20 minutes, and more if time allows, up to 30 minutes), so that staff members can show each audience member to their assigned seat. Audience members will be shown to their seats in an order set by the devices to ensure that no breaking of distancing occurs. No changes of seating will be permitted on the day.

All shows will be operating under out ‘No late entry’ policy, meaning that after the show goes up any entry will not be permitted. Shows may continue to allow audience members in at the interval, though in this case audience members will not normally be allowed to wait elsewhere in the building and will instead be advised a time to return.

At the start of each show, a pre-recorded announcement will play, detailing building rules: please do not get up from your seat during the show, and remain in your seat until ushered out at the interval(s) and end of show.

## Signage

**What this means for you:** Signage around the building will be updated to reflect our recent logo update, including new floor signs and other general updates. Digital signage will replace leaflets, promoting sustainability.

All signs featuring the Bedlam Theatre logo will be updated with the newly designed logo. Floor signs will be updated to ensure clear messaging of COVID-19 measures to those building. In the Box Office area, digital signs will replace paper leaflets and flyers, promoting the building’s sustainability and further reducing the chance of COVID-19 spread. These will feature further explanation of Bedlam Theatre’s COVID-19 measures as well as show advertisements.

## Notes

[^1]:
     This section broadly defines pricing mitigation for increased costs due to COVID-19.

[^2]:
     To cover pretix pricing (2.5% purchase price) and stripe pricing (1.4% + 20p), plus a buffer to cover us in case of disputes, refunds etc. - It’s worth noting EUSA will effectively get more per ticket as they were paying fees on SagePay and MSL before.

[^3]:
     To protect Box Office Staff, and will more than cover square’s 1.75% - again EUSA will receive significantly more per ticket sold in person than before. We want to use Square to integrate with pretix (this is NOT mandatory), and to reduce paperwork which should reduce contact vectors.

[^4]:
     This clarifies existing policy, reducing eligibility slightly for concessions, increasing revenue - while being fairer.

[^5]:
     Cost to be borne by reduced comp allowance for 2021-22, comp will be reduced by 1 per carer for a future show

[^6]:
     Increases revenue and decreases chances of refunds in general, maintaining predictable attendance levels.

[^7]:
     Proportional to reduced capacity, increases revenue
