## General information

**ALL** posters and publicity of your show must both have the Bedlam Theatre and EUTC Logos.

You can use this guide to easily pick the correct logo to use.

You should not modify the logos without permission, and they should only be used for things directly related to Bedlam Theatre and/or the EUTC.

In order of preference, you should use:

1. The base multiline logo with dark text
2. Then light text
3. Then the single line version with dark text (aka lateral)
4. Then light text

The multiline version with dark text, usually shown on a light background, is the official logo of both Bedlam Theatre (the building) and the EUTC (the society):

<img src="branding/svg/bedlam-logo_base-multiline.svg" width="30%" alt="Bedlam Theatre EUTC Multiline logo with black text" />

An example of the single line version.

## Pick a logo 

You can keep reading or use the Table of Contents to more easily select your logo. Follow it as a step-by-step reference.

### For an EUTC show that takes place in Bedlam

Use the combined Bedlam Theatre/EUTC logo in any colour scheme, in either the multiline or single line version. Examples are above.

### For a non-EUTC show that takes place in Bedlam

Use the combined Bedlam Theatre logo without the EUTC mark in any colour scheme, in either the multiline or single line version.

<img src="branding/svg/bedlam-logo_base-multiline-no-eutc.svg" width="30%" alt="Bedlam Theatre EUTC Multiline logo with black text" />

or alternatively the single line version:

<img src="branding/svg/bedlam-logo_single-line-no-eutc.svg" width="30%" alt="Bedlam Theatre EUTC Multiline logo with black text" />
