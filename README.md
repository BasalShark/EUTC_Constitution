# EUTC Constitution

This repository is used for collaborative editing of the Edinburgh
University Theatre Company's constitution and standing orders, with
robust version tracking.

This is to be the authoritative copy of the constitution.

The 'master' branch is the official and currently in use branch and
has been protected from pushes. Changes to this branch need to be agreed
through standard constitution change processes, including being approved
by committee/company as appropriate. Please use branches and forks for
development.

There is a Yarn script, and Travis Ci pipeline on this repository to
automatically generate a nicely formatted PDF of the constitution on
changes.
