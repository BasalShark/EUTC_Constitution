The Production Guidelines of the Edinburgh University Theatre Company
==========================
This version adopted 28.10.2020

# 1. Proposing a Show
## 1.1 TIMELINE
The EUTC selects shows at General Meetings (GMs), open to all members, and usually held on a Wednesday. The Productions Manager will open proposals about two weeks before a GM, making clear what you can apply for (i.e. which classifications, and how many slots for each). There are two deadlines to consider:
- **By the Submission deadline (18:00, Monday 10 days before the GM), you must have submitted your first draft.** Make it as complete as possible. Committee will point out any omissions, and may offer advice, which you don’t have to take.
- **By the Editing deadline (18:00, Monday 2 days before the GM) you must have completed your final draft.** Committee will block any proposal that doesn’t strictly meet the requirements of the Constitution (clause 6B/3). The rules are mostly common sense: don’t propose anything illegal or dangerous, name a member in each required role. That sort of thing. Supplementary events must be presented to the Committee at least two weeks before the Editing Deadline.
- If these deadlines are moved back, Committee will make that clear. 

At the GM, your team will generally introduce themselves and announce any members who aren’t present and then have three minutes to stand up and pitch your proposal to the room.  Most teams choose to do this by going through their proposal a section at a time but you can do it however you like, questions will then be opened up to the floor. Talk to the Productions Manager if you need help preparing. The Chair of the GM will talk you through it on the day if you ask.
## 1.2 CLASSIFICATIONS
All EUTC events are either “Reserved” or “Supplementary”. The difference is described in the Constitution (clause 6A/4), but in short:
- *Reserved events* are predictable. The Committee creates a calendar each year allocating certain times (usually whole weeks) to certain classifications. The slots in this calendar are then filled by the shows voted on at GMs
- *Supplementary events* fill in the gaps. Examples include our long-running Candlewasters new writing showcase, sketch shows, site-specific theatre outside Bedlam, etc. Their budgets and timings are entirely unspecified, giving you a lot of freedom. However, they must work around Reserved events, and cannot clash with them without permission.
### Types of Reserved show
- *Lunchtimes*
  - **1 or 2 performances**
  - **EUTC grant: £65 without rights, £125 with rights**
  - Less financial risk, but fewer resources.
  - Can be good for new teams, or for more experimental ideas.
- *Mainterms*
  - **3 to 5 performances**
  - **EUTC grant: £850 without rights, £1050 with rights**
  - Larger budget, longer run, more high profile.
  - More resources mean it is more demanding on the production teams, but they can be bigger and bolder.
- *Pantomime*
  - The final week of Semester 1
  - Administratively identical to a Mainterm show, except it’s a panto.
- *Friday Night Improv*
  - 22:30, weekly throughout term-time.
  - EUTC grant: Discuss with the Business Manager.
- *Freshers’ Play*
  - Week 2, semester 1.
  - EUTC grant: Discuss with the Business Manager.
  - Freshers’ Play itself is proposed near the end of the academic year, to be run as an induction event the following September. Ask the Productions Manager for details.
  - **This is a Mandatory event (see Constitution 6B/9)**
- *Freshers’ Slots*
  - The penultimate week of Semester 1.
  - Three separate shows in one night.
  - EUTC grant: £40 + Rights
  - The assumption is that the show teams are predominantly composed of those new to the
EUTC.
  - Extremely low pressure, with a high level of support from the EUTC Committee
- *EUTC Fringe show*
  - During one of the slots allocated to us by Bedlam Fringe. There will be at least one a year, usually two.
  - EUTC grant: Discuss with the Business Manager. Note that there is no venue cost.
  - One of the best ways to take a show to Fringe in a familiar environment with minimal pressure.
  - Marketing, and logistics at Fringe can be very different to term-time; it is a good idea to talk at length to relevant members of Committee before proposing.
- *Youth Project*
  - After semester 2
  - EUTC grant: Discuss with the Business Manager.
  - The youth project is when young people get the opportunity to do workshops and a show with the EUTC.

### Festivals
Festivals are events where the Committee delegates many of their responsibilities to a Subcommittee: the festival team. (This is fully explained in the Constitution; Articles 4C and 6C). They are usually week-long events (but can be shorter) and include a self-contained programme, usually including small-scale performances and workshops. Festivals are not shows, but they are proposed in the same way, and can still be classed as “Reserved” or “Supplementary” in exactly the same way.
**By the Editing deadline, Festival proposals must have at least one named Administrator/Convenor,** who is responsible for running the festival team and ensuring the event happens. **Before the event actually happens, the team must have gained:**
- **A technical manager**
- **A theatre manager**
- **A box office manager** (if there is a box office)
- **A café manager** (if the café is to be used)
- **A marketing manager**

The festival team can curate their program by any method they choose. They may also set prices, menus and marketing policies. Festival teams must maintain regular communication with the Committee, as the Theatre Manager still holds the license during this time and is still responsible.
There are two Reserved festivals each year:
- *Welcome Week* takes place in Week 0 of Semester 1. This is a Mandatory event (see Constitution 6B/9)
- *Bedlam Festival* (or BedFest) takes place in Week 1 of Semester 2.
## 1.3 WHAT SHOULD YOUR PROPOSAL INCLUDE? 
The proposal forms are on the members’ section of the website. There are two main boxes; publicity text (a brief blurb) and proposal text (the body of your proposal, split up under broad headings like “Direction”, “Props” and “Tech”). Looking at old proposals is recommended for getting a feel of what is expected there and these can be found in the proposals section on the Bedlam website. However, your proposal must include:
- **Your team.** 
  - **Show proposals must include at least: a Director, a Producer, a Stage Manager and a Technical Manager.** Festivals are different (see above). 
  - **Everyone listed on the proposal must have EUTC membership** (purchased on the EUSA website or at the box office, but must be activated by emailing the Secretary) 
- **A justifiable budget, passed by the Business Manager**
  - This includes both expenditure (what you plan to spend) and income (consisting of an EUTC  grant and your own fundraising targets). - Expenditure is usually split into: Rights/Publicity/Tech/Set/Costume/Props/Admin, and a Contingency which is 10% of all the others combined. 
  - If you’re proposing a show with an unconventional budget, it is a good idea to chat with the Business Manager before proposing. 
  - By the editing deadline, your budget must have been sent to, and approved by, the Business Manager, regardless of what type of performance you are proposing 
  - **Supplementary Events must make back their EUTC grant, preferably through their ticket sales, or as a last resort through retroactive fundraising.**
  - It should be noted that Supplementary Events must make their money back. Shows that fail to do this will be required to fundraise retrospectively. 
- **Details on performance rights** – your legal licence to perform. 
  - (You obviously don’t need these for original writing, or works out of copyright) - We strongly encourage trying to get a performance/prospective license drawn up before proposal as if successful, the invoice will need to be processed and paid as soon as possible. 
  - **Without rights, you aren’t legally allowed to start rehearsals!** 
  - (More details in section 2). 
- At the end of the proposal there are a number of simple questions to be answered (e.g. length of 
the show and gender breakdown of characters, although an increasing number of shows audition and cast gender-blind) 

*N.B. For a detailed explanation of the process by which show proposals are selected, please see Articles 5A, 5B, 6A and 6B of the EUTC Constitution*
# 2. From Passing to Performing
## 2.1 Immediate Next Steps 
- **Show teams must make a concerted effort to get at least three members of their team Duty Manager trained.** The Front of House Manager *(foh@bedlamtheatre.co.uk)* will run regular sessions to facilitate this and has discretion to require more than three team members be DM trained on larger teams. 
- **Shows must nominate two welfare contacts before rehearsals begin.** We recommend having a welfare contact for the cast, and a separate one for the crew, both of whom must have suitable emotional distance from the rest of the other welfare contacts. 
- **Show teams must start sending a representative to Company Meetings every Monday night.**
## 2.2 RIGHTS 
If your piece is out of copyright (such as Shakespeare), or original writing by an EUTC member then you will not need rights! 
- **For original writing by an EUTC member, the writer must approve the choice of Director and Producer by emailing the Committee.** 
- All original writing must be sent to the Archives Subcommittee after your final performance: *archives@bedlamtheatre.co.uk*

**Rights are LEGALLY needed for rehearsals to begin,** so you should organise a prospective license/license invoice before the GM so you can send this to Business Manager for quick payment. 
### Advice 
- Published versions of the script should include details of who to contact about rights, usually a 
company like Samuel French. 
- Apply for rights ASAP after the GM. It sometimes takes a while for them to come through, so 
allow two weeks for them to be paid. 
- You will need to inform the rights company of the length of your run. 
- Some playwrights will not allow any changes to the script, others may allow a certain amount; 
check this to avoid hassle later. 
- To avoid paying too much, stress that it is an amateur production, by a non-profit making theatre company, in a student theatre with a capacity under 100. 
- Check that the playwright is VAT registered as we can claim the VAT back.
- You can ask actors to buy their own copy of the script. If you are going to photocopy them, you should do it yourself and collect money from each cast member to pay for it. 
## 2.3 AUDITIONS AND CASTING
Immediately following the GM, the Productions Manager will arrange a suitable time and place for auditions to be held, in conversation with the relevant show teams. Typically, there are two days of auditions, followed by another evening of callbacks.
Show teams should bring their own audition material (around 50 pieces is recommended), and a short show blurb, printed, to auditions. 
Should an actor audition for multiple shows and be fortunate enough to get cast in more than one of them, it is at the discretion of the actor which part they accept. 

## 2.4 REHEARSALS 
###### This section was reviewed by the Secretary, who can be contacted at secretary@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
Rehearsals in Bedlam and EUSA buildings (Teviot and Pleasance) will be available to every show team. Priority will be given to shows that will perform sooner. Show teams should inform the Secretary of their preferred rehearsal times. 
To request additional rehearsal space, email the Secretary at *secretary@bedlamtheatre.co.uk* detailing which rooms you would like, the date, time, and what show team/project it is for. Extra rehearsal spaces in university buildings can also be booked by any University of Edinburgh student via MyEd. Should you require assistance on how to do so, contact the Secretary. If you have a small cast, rehearsing in flats (or any other space you can find) might be a good idea. 
### Rules for rehearsing in Bedlam: 
- Please refer to the section labelled Being in the Building. 
### Rules for EUSA room use: 
- **Do not book a room directly with EUSA under the EUTC’s name.** Please ask the Secretary 
instead. 
- If allocated a room, use the room. It is EUSA policy that if the room is found unoccupied during our room booking slot, the society might not be able to book EUSA rooms in the future. 
- Leave the room in the state that you found it. All chairs/tables should be put back in the same way that they were found in, and all rubbish should be completely cleared away. If the society gets any complaints about rooms not being left as they were found or rooms going unused, the show teams responsible may lose access to them. 
- If you are allocated a room and no longer want/need it: 
  - More than 1 week before the booking: 
    - Contact the Secretary or offer it up on the EUTC Room Bookings Facebook group. If no one takes it, the Secretary will offer it up to other societies or cancel the booking. 
  - More than 24 hours before the booking: 
    - Contact the Secretary and they will find another use for it as above, but they cannot cancel it with EUSA. 
  - Less than 24 hours before the booking: 
    - Contact the Secretary and they will try to find another use for it as above, but it is likely that  the room will have to be babysat. This literally means having someone sit in it for the duration of the slot. If you can’t find someone, the Secretary will be able to help. 
## 2.5 PUBLICITY 
###### This section was reviewed by the Marketing Manager, who can be contacted at marketing@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
### A couple of deadlines and timeline information:
- Cast and production team lists are due within a week of your show being cast
- You should submit a poster design to the marketing manager with adequate time for an A0 poster to be made for the front of bedlam.
- Your show will be made public on the Bedlam page and EUSA site two weeks before opening night
- You must send your show blurb and Facebook event cover to the marketing manager at least 16 days before opening night so your Facebook and EUSA event can go up in time.
### Bedlam will provide:
- A facebook event for your show (which producers will be made admins of)
- An A0 poster in the red boxes outside bedlam
- Access to Bedlam’s Instagram and tiktok on the week of the show
- Bedlam will post trailers/cast lists on the facebook page
- Bedlam’s facebook page’s cover photo will be changed to your show’s publicity the week of the show
### What should your publicity include?
As always if you have any specific questions don’t hesitate to get in touch with the marketing manager but as a guide please follow these rules:
- **You must get all publicity checked and approved by the Marketing Manager before use.** This includes posters, flyers, trailers, cast lists and press releases.  Please allow time for changes to be made if asked to make them.
- The phrase: “The EUTC presents” or “The Edinburgh University Theatre Company Presents”
- Correct ticket prices, (if you are unsure what there are contact the front of house manager at foh@bedlamtheatre.co.uk)
- Both the EUTC and Bedlam logos (See the bedlam wiki, linked below)
- Any specific requirements of your rights agreement
### What Publicity should you make?
Cast and Production team lists:
- An artistic list announcing the cast and production team of your show
- Drums up interest in the show early on
- Make sure to make one for cast and one for production team, or to include them both in one
- It is worth thinking about these straight away as they are due within a week of casting

Posters:
- You need to design a poster to go outside of Bedlam
- Most people will hear about shows through social media so we advise you limit the number of posters you print to prevent waste
- They should include all of the design elements listed above

Putting posters up:
- You need a EUSA stamp to put up posters in university buildings, these can be obtained in the Potterrow Societies office or on the reception desk in teviot
- Don’t put posters up over official EUSA event posters as they will be removed
- You’re more than welcome to put up posters around bedlam
- Ask before you put them up in coffee shops, hairdressers etc.
- Allow proper time for printing

Flyers:
- We strongly advise against using flyers as they’re not very effective and very unsustainable
- The Front of House Manager won’t allow flyers to be left in Bedlam due to commitment to sustainability
- If you still want to use flyers they need to include the basic design elements listed above and be approved by the marketing manager

Facebook page/event cover photos:
- These are to be sent to the marketing manager at least 16 days before the show opens so that they can update the facebook pages and make an event.
- Dimensions:
- Cover photo for the Bedlam page: 820 x 312 px
- Event cover photo: 1920 x 1080
- These need to include the basic design elements above

Headshots:
- These are a great way to advertise your show!
- Although they don’t need to have anything on them, headshots caption need to include:
- The EUTC presents “Title of Show” by Author of the Show
- The dates and times
- The ticket prices
- The location
- A link to the facebook event or EUSA ticketing website

### Other points
- Getting the press in for interviews, previews, or reviews will help sell the show. Get information out early, typically as soon as possible but at least two weeks before the show before the show. Keep reminding the press about the show.
- Programmes are expensive and can be a drain on resources, but can help to enhance your audience experience and make good souvenirs. If you do want to produce them, they must include ‘Edinburgh University Theatre Company Presents’ and both the EUTC and Bedlam Theatre logos.
- [EUTC Wiki Marketing Resources](https://wiki.bedlamtheatre.co.uk/en/craft/producing/marketing). This is a great page that expands on the points highlighted in this section, including extra information about the Bedlam Instagram and TikTok accounts.
## 2.6 QUESTIONNAIRES 
###### This section was reviewed by the Theatre Manager, Set Manager and Technical Manager. 
**Questionnaires are forms that your show team are required to fill out by 18:00 on the Monday before your Get In.** They are read by members of the Committee so they can support your show. 
Questionnaires are located at the bottom of your show page on the Bedlam website, and will usually go live a week before they are due. Questionnaires will only show if you are listed as a member of the show team. 
There are 4 questionnaires: 
- *Tech Manager Questionnaire (TMQs)*
  - This is where you list everything that is going to be done tech-wise. 
  - It is read by the Tech Manager. 
  - Your tech manager will fill it out. 
- *Stage Manager Questionnaire (SMQs)*
  - This questionnaire is about anything stage or set related. 
  - It is read by the Set and Theatre Managers.
  - Your stage manager (and set manager if you have one) will fill it out. 
- *Costume Manager Questionnaire (CMQs)*
  - This concerns anything and everything related to costumes.
  - It is read by the Wardrobe Manager.
  - Your costume manager (or stage manager if you don’t have one) will fill it out.
- *Producer Questionnaire (PQs)* 
  - This is about the show details, including run time, ticketing, and publicity.
  - This will also include any content warnings, talk to the Front of House Manager if not sure about this.
  - It is read by the Front of House and Marketing Managers.
  - It will be filled out by your producer(s). 
  
If you need help to answer your questionnaire, or are unable to complete your questionnaire by the deadline, please contact the relevant Committee member before the deadline. 
## 2.7 GET INS 
A get in is the time that is allocated for your play to rig and focus your lights, and prepare the stage for your show. Get ins start on Saturday at 2pm for Mainterm productions or Sunday at 2pm for Lunchtime productions.
- A get in can be very hectic. You must plan ahead for it. Coordinate with the teams before and after you to work most efficiently. 
- **You must fit the Improverts rehearsal at 18:00-20:00 each Sunday into your plan.** This involves clearing the stage as much as you can and being quiet for the duration (good time to get some supper). If this isn’t possible you must contact the Improverts’ producers at least a week in advance as they have a regularly booked rehearsal and so take priority.
- If you wish to store props, wood, or anything else in Bedlam for your show before the get in, please talk to the Set Manager. 
### Extended get ins / get outs 
You may request for more time for your get in or get out at a Company Meeting. Normally, an extended get in starts at 09:00 Saturday, but can start earlier. To qualify: 
- **It must be requested at least 2 weeks before your first performance.**
- **There must be an obvious requirement for it.**
- **It must not conflict with any other show or event, or any conflict must have been agreed to.** You don’t get one automatically. It is your responsibility to find out and talk to all shows or events that may be affected before the meeting. Consult the production schedule or ask Committee if you are unsure. 
### Regular weekly events 
- 21:00-23:30 Friday - Imps show 
- 12:00-14:00 Saturday - Imps workshop 
- 12:00-14:00 Sunday - Maintenance 
- 18:00-20:00 Sunday - Imps Rehearsal 
### Occasional events 
- General Meetings (Wednesday Afternoons)
- Candlewasters, and other Supplementary shows. (Usually Friday-Saturday)
- Lock-in (Saturday Nights)
# 3. Practical Advice
## 3.1 BEING IN THE BUILDING
###### This section was reviewed by the Theatre Manager, who can be contacted at theatre@bedlamtheatre.co.uk 
Duty Manager Training:
- Duty Manager (DM) Training covers opening, locking up, fire, and other procedures for the Bedlam Theatre. It is arranged every week when possible by the Theatre Manager and if completed allows members to be in the building by themselves/staff as a DM.
- **You must always have a Duty Manager in the building.**
- **At least three members of your production team must get DM training as soon as it is practical.** This will help with get ins/rehearsals/show nights/staffing later on.

Access:
- The DM keys do not give access to the building and **must not leave the building at any time.**
- To get access to the building, you will need to arrange for a Committee/Subcommittee member to let you in. Ask with at least 24 hours notice.
- Don’t leave the building until you’ve handed over the DM keys to someone else who is Duty Manager trained. If you are the last person out, make sure the fire exits are locked and the door is double locked.
- The Stage Manager of your show also gets a set of keys from your Get In to your Get Out. To procure a set speak to the Theatre Manager. **You must be DM Trained and cannot hand the keys around your production team**
## 3.2 SHOW FINANCES
###### This section was reviewed by the Business Manager, who can be contacted at business@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
- **You must stick to your budget. Any overspend that has not been approved will not be reimbursed.** Remind all crew that they are not to spend ANY MONEY without the producer’s say-so and that they MUST give you a receipt if they want to be reimbursed. 
- **Any budget increases or changes must be proposed at a Committee Meeting, consulting with the Business Manager.**
- Invoices for any expenses should be placed in Business Manager’s pigeonhole in the Bedlam Office, or emailed to the Business Manager at *business@bedlamtheatre.co.uk.* This is the same for any receipts for reimbursements. Remember to include name and bank details for each receipt. Make sure the Business Manager knows what needs to be paid urgently (such as rights), as well as keeping them up to date on your expenditure. 
- **Anything you purchase with your show budget (like furniture, paint etc) will be added to the EUTC’s general stock after your run.**
- **Any tech hires must be approved by the Technical Manager.** 
- If you have any problems or questions there is a Business resources section on the Bedlam website. Failing that, please talk to the Business Manager. 
- Bedlam’s alumni group, Friends of Bedlam (FoB), can offer grants to partly fund parts of your show. The application form is on the Business Resources section of the website.
  - FoB will only fund up to 50% of a project. FoB is interested in funding projects that have long term value to the company. 
  - **Grant applications must be brought to a committee meeting to discuss it before you can send it to FoB.**

## 3.3 FUNDRAISING
**Fundraisers must be proposed at a Committee meeting.** You should give Committee as much notice as possible. Committee can reject a fundraiser if it clashes with another EUTC event, or if there is insufficient evidence to vote on it. To propose a fundraiser you should explain the following:
- What you are intending to do.
- How and where you are intending to do it.
- A time and a date.
- How much you are intending to fundraise.
- You cannot spend any fundraised money without it first being given to and checked and deposited by the Business Manager
. 
Examples of fundraisers include bake sales, dances, raffles and music nights, but can take almost any form. If you’re stuck for ideas, talk to the Social Events Manager. 
## 3.4 HEALTH AND SAFETY (INCLUDING FIRE AND WEAPONS) 
###### This section was reviewed by the Theatre Manager, who can be contacted at theatre@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
There is an EUTC health and safety folder, maintained by the Theatre Manager. This can be found in the Office. Some key points are:
- **Practise Common Sense, please.**
- If your show involves any stunts, stage combat or other things likely to result in injuries, **you must notify the Theatre Manager during your first week of rehearsals.**
- Record any accidents in the accident book, and report them to the Theatre Manager. The accident report/near miss book can be found in the Office 
- There is a First Aid kit behind the box office.  You must tell the Theatre Manager if you use any first aid supplies. Otherwise the box will not get restocked
- Only people who have been trained how to do tasks should attempt to do them.  This is especially true of anything potentially dangerous, eg. use of power tools, rigging, building flats, etc.  If you are unsure of anything, speak to the Theatre, Set or Tech Managers.

**You must speak to the Theatre Manager if you plan to do any of the following:**
- **Smoking is not allowed anywhere in the building, including herbal cigarettes.** Electronic Cigarettes are legal on stage but make sure to isolate first.
- **Lasers need permission from the Council**. This can take up to two months to come through.
- **Fire/pyrotechnics need permission from Fire Scotland.** This can take some time so speak to the Theatre Manager well in advance.
- **Firearms need permission from Police Scotland.** This can take some time so speak to the Theatre Manager well in advance. Firearms should never be used backstage or on the balconies, nor pointed at the audience, as is guidance by Police Scotland.

## 3.5 WELFARE 
Remain vigilant in regard to the welfare of your cast and crew. 
- **You are required to have two welfare contacts agreed upon by the cast and crew.** Traditionally, the Stage Manager is one. Each welfare contact should have enough distance from the other, personally, that any cast and crew members should feel comfortable speaking to one of them about any matter arising with them. 
- The Productions Manager will make a note of the welfare officers’ names. The Productions Manager and/or the EUTC’s three core welfare contacts (President, Committee-elected and Company-elected) will liaise with them and advise them of their roles.
- Members of cast and crew can go straight to the three EUTC welfare contacts to raise concerns, and do not need a specific reason to do so. - Refer to Articles 3A and 3C of the Constitution and to the Welfare Agreement on the website for further details. 
- There is also an [online complaints form](https://bedlamtheatre.co.uk/complaints) which can be used if an individual doesn’t feel comfortable going through the channels listed above.
## 3.6 TECH
###### This section was reviewed by the Technical Manager, who can be contacted at tech@bedlamtheatre.co.uk. 
- **Your show’s technical manager must complete the tech manager’s questionnaire (TMQ) at the latest by the Monday of the week before your performance.** This questionnaire should include documentation of rig plans, a Get in plan, DMX runs and any planned changes to set up of the tech in the theatre. Points to note: 
  - **Any planned hires should be run through the EUTC Technical Manager two weeks in advance of the questionnaire deadline.** 
  - You should seek the advice of the Technical or Theatre Managers regarding health and safety and building regulations. 
  - It might be useful for your show’s technical team to meet with the EUTC Technical Manager, to go through anything they are unsure about in the runup to show week. 
- To ensure your Get in is run efficiently, talk not only with your set-building colleagues, but also the tech teams before and after you. Your rig plans might have a lot in common. 
  - **It is imperative that everyone that might be going up a ladder be ladder trained by the EUTC Technical Manager.** A list will be kept by Committee to ensure that safe working practises are maintained. Ladder training will be run at the beginning of each semester, and on an ad hoc basis thereafter.
  - It is strongly encouraged that you make an event on Facebook in the Bedlam Techies group to promote your Get In to encourage people to come along  
- The technical rehearsal (or tech run) usually falls on the Monday evening of show week, this is a very important time to ensure that the tech for the show is all set up and programmed to a sufficient standard before the dress rehearsal. 
  - It is important that the whole show team and cast understand that *this is the tech team’s time and they are in charge.*
  - The EUTC Technical Manager will be on call for the tech run, dress run and first night for any issues the tech team may have. Their contact details are displayed in the tech box. 
- **Any gels cut for the show must be labelled correctly** (as shown in a poster above the gel cutting station by hard patch) **and returned to the correct file at the end of the show run.** If you cut gel from the rolled gel storage make sure to roll it back up tightly and place it back in the correct slot for the next person to use. 
- **Get out must be completed on the last night of the show.** There is a checklist to ensure nothing is forgotten. A copy should be in the tech box, but there is also a copy here. 
- If any equipment is faulty or breaks during the Get In or run of the show, please report it.   If something breaks during your run, don’t panic, but please inform the Technical Manager ASAP so that they can try and resolve the situation.
## 3.7 SET 
###### This section was reviewed by the Set Manager, who can be contacted at set@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
### Construction 
This generally boils down to:
- If you are not sure, ask the Set Manager.
- Clean up after yourself
- Building things needs to be safe. 
  - **Do not use tools that you have not been tool trained on. Tool training can be arranged easily with the Set Manager with enough notice.** 
  - **Do not use power tools in the building past midnight without permission from the Set Manager**
- Built things need to be safe and legal. 
  - **If cardboard, paper, or polystyrene is to be used in set construction it must be passed by the theatre Manager and treated with the necessary Flamebar flame retardant (N5, S3, or SIWA2).** Bedlam may not have stock of these if you do not get in contact with the Theatre Manager in time (≥2 weeks before Get In).
  - All built things may be inspected by the Set Manager or Theatre Manager. If your construction is somehow classified as unsafe, your production may be suspended until it is rectified (see Constitution Article 6D).

Additional permission (from relevant people, at least 2 weeks in advance) must be sought for:
- **Constructing anything that is not a free-standing structure for use on stage (Set Manager).**
- **Drilling or screwing into the stage (Set and Theatre Managers, will always be discourage)**
- **Attaching anything other than fixtures to the rig (Tech Manager)**
- **Building or painting anywhere other than the stage or the workshop, especially the café and other front of house areas (FOH and Theatre Managers)**
- **Modifying or decorating anywhere not on the stage, like the front of house areas or auditorium walls (FOH and Theatre Managers)**
- **Any construction designed to be walked on that is higher than 600mm (requires Raised Structure licence from the Council, coordinate with Committee).**
- **Any change to the layout of the Bedlam stage and seating plan (generally requires Conversion licence from the Council, coordinate with Committee).**

## 4.2 MAINTENANCE
###### This section was reviewed by the Theatre Manager, who can be contacted at theatre@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
- The Sunday after your get-out all cast and crew must attend maintenance at 12:00. If you cannot attend maintenance, contact the Theatre Manager (the night before at the latest) to make alternate arrangements to make up for this.

## 4.3 DEBRIEFING 
- You must attend the Monday Company Meeting after the last performance of your show to report to the Company. 
- This is your chance to talk about what worked or didn’t and for you and Committee members to raise and discuss any problems. 
## 4.4 STAFFING
###### This section was reviewed by the Front of House Manager, who can be contacted at foh@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
- Assigned staffing weeks for each production will be assigned by the Front of House Manager (FoH).
- **All members of a production must staff.** This includes Director(s), Tech Managers, Stage Managers, Producer(s), tech operators, and the cast. This is not limited to those listed on the proposal form. Those involved in a Lunchtime show must staff one slot each, and those involved in a Mainterm show must staff two slots each.
- There are five staffing slots that need to be filled by each production; Duty Manager, Box Office, Indoor Hall Keeper, Outdoor Hall Keeper and Café. The responsibilities of each position are detailed in the Staffing Guidelines. 
- Signing up to staff can be done online through the Bedlam website: *https://www.bedlamtheatre.co.uk/admin/staffings* 
- Staffers must be in Bedlam an hour and a half before the performance or as specified on the 
staffing sign-up page. 
- **A show team must be signed up for at least one slot each by midday Friday on their assigned week** (usually two weeks before the show). Shows are encouraged to staff this week but they can sign up for any slot, including after their show. Mainterm shows must sign up for their second slot by midday Friday the week before their show.
- If you find yourself unable to staff the slot you signed up for, you can request to swap your slot, provided you give at least 24 hours notice. Otherwise, you’ll need to find someone to replace you.
- People staffing when it is not required of them are able to be removed from staffing slots as long 
as at least 24h notice is given.
- If either a Lunchtime or a Mainterm production chooses to have an additional performance, it is the 
producer’s responsibility to find staffers for that performance.
- It is the producer’s responsibility to find staffers for all supplementary events unless another 
agreement is reached with the Front-of-House manager. 
## 4.5 DEBT
* When you take part in a show at Bedlam Theatre, you make use of our lovely building and facilities. We’re entirely student-run, and the building is entirely staffed and managed by students.
* To ensure fairness, we require anyone taking part in a show to ‘give back’ to the society. For Lunchtimes this means doing a staffing slot and turning up to maintenance on the Sunday after you show. For Mainterms this means staffing twice and turning up to maintenance. For anything else please confirm your staffing obligation with the Front of House manager.
* On the rare occasion that people don’t sign-up to staff their slots/turn up to maintenance in good time, and without a good excuse, we use a system called Debt to enforce this requirement.
  * There are two types of Debt: Maintenance Debt and Staffing Debt, which are administered by the Theatre Manager and the Front of House Manager respectively.
  * Debt is cleared by performing the maintenance task or staffing the required FOH slot(s). It can also be cleared by getting in contact with the welfare contacts.
  * You can find out your Debt status through the website.
